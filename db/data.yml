    - Flux
    - Marketing
    - This company was founded in January 2015. The idea was built around the Chinese
      enthusiasm for domestically utilised E-bikes with the intent of designing and
      manufacturing their own models that would appeal more to the western market.
      So far this company has created 3 bespoke model prototypes that are ready to
      be taken into full production. The design focus has been making all the bikes
      highly stylish as well as delivering exceptional performance capabilities. New
      designs and concepts are already in the planning phases for the second wave
      of development. The next step in the company?�?s marketing model is to create
      a video production for the crowdfunding campaign. This is currently in the planning
      process and should hopefully be released late January / early February.  This
      company is initially looking to release its models into North America and then
      Europe at a later date. Both markets are in the initial growth stages and due
      to large scale government investment in bicycle infrastructure and rapid development
      in battery technology the potential for future growth is vast. An estimated
      30 million e-bikes were sold worldwide in 2012. That?�?s projected to increase
      to 47.6 million in 2018.

    - Hospitality
    - This company is a five-room guesthouse refurnished from a traditional Chinese
      courtyard in Sanduhe Village of Huairou District, just 5km from Mutianyu Great
      Wall. More than just a lodging, they are a social enterprise with a unique organizational
      philosophy built on the concepts of ??? and ???. ??? or ?�?h???�? ??? balance
      | ??? or ?�?y???�? = meaningfulness They seek balance (???) between mother nature
      and human beings, embodied in every aspect of teh guesthouse from food to architecture
      to how they operate their business. In their meals they balance ?�?yin?�? foods
      with ?�?yang?�? ingredients to nourish theri bodies; in their guest rooms they
      balance comfort and simplicity while preserving the authenticity of their space;
      in their yard they balance nature with functionality; and while the guesthouse?�?s
      staff is committed to creating a welcoming and relaxing environment, they encourage
      guests to be independent from helping themselves to beverages to clearing their
      own used dishes, and therefore truly feel at home away from home. ??? (y??)
      is a concept that can only be understood by experience, and is the driving force
      behind how the guesthouse operates. As a lodging, they try to foster an environment
      in which staff and guests feel balance (???) during their stay. As a social
      enterprise, they aim to involve and to give back to their community, as well
      as to protect the natural environment. They do so in various ways such as growing
      their own food or sourcing them locally, upcycling building materials, hiring
      local staff and offering a free bi-monthly cooking workshop.

    - 'HOW IT STARTED: Liam, Swiss national and founder, was living in Beijing when
      his fianc??e, Jess, decided to move from Canada so they could be together.  Within
      a week Jess developed asthma, which she had experienced when she was a child
      but left behind twenty years ago.  If they were going to continue to live in
      Beijing, something had to change.  The goal: to create a system that would provide
      a clean environment for truly healthy living, wherever you live. Liam had high
      standards: if they were to keep living in China, the air in their apartment
      must be as clean as the air in his home in Switzerland.  So, he has found the
      best filter technology from Switzerland and brought it to China with the confidence
